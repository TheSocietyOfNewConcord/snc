Please join the Society of New Concord Google Group; all our notifications of events, news, and local milestones (like the recent deaths of some of our neighbors) are done through the group. To be sure you get appropriately updated, we ask that you sign up. The group is NOT public, and only members and friends of the Society can view or post messages. In the past there have been, on average, only 10 messages per year, so you won't risk feeling 'spammed' by signing on. And we'd hate to miss informing you of something important to the community.

Thanks,
--Rick Karpinski, VP, the Society of New Concord
