subhead: In Conjunction with Red Rock Historical Society

  A lusciously-illustrated slide talk on food and drink, seen in the seventeenth century Dutch Masters and their relevance to the American kitchen today. It explores the food ways brought to America by the Dutch more than three centuries ago, and how these foods were changed and adapted uner the new circumstances.
  
  Using slides of some 40 paintings by Jan Steen, Adriaen van Ostade, Jan Davidsz DeHeem, Pieter Claesz, Harmen van Steenwijck and many others, the lecture will demonstrate how these art works give an insight into 17th Century food practices and shed new light on the colonial diet.
